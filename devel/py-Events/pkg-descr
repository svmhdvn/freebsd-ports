Bringing the elegance of C# EventHandler to Python

The C# language provides a handy way to declare, subscribe to and fire events.
Technically, an event is a "slot" where callback functions (event handlers) can
be attached to - a process referred to as subscribing to an event.

This is a handy package that encapsulates the core to event subscription and
event firing and feels like a "natural" part of the language.
