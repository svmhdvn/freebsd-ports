OBNC is a compiler for Niklaus Wirth's programming language Oberon. It
implements the final version of the language from 2016. OBNC translates source
code written in Oberon to the lower-level programming language C. The
translated code is then compiled and linked using the C compiler and linker of
the host operating system. The build command obnc performs all these tasks and
keeps track of which files need to be compiled or recompiled.
